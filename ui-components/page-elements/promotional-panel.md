## Promotional panel

This section displays items of the Promotion content type that are flagged as 'Promoted to front page'.

**Drupal how to**

1. Create your promotions in Content &gt; Add Content &gt; Promotions first.
2. In the Content tab press the + button on the right. Select Promotion pane. 
3. Title: the text will go above the promos.
4. References: add four entries. Enter the names of the promos you created for this page. If you don't know which ones you want to use, you can come back and add them later. There should always be 4 or, with permission from your team leader or higher, a number that is divisible by 4 \(8, 12, etc.\)
5. View mode: Full \(default\)
6. Select Finish
