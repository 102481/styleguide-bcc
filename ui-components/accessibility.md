# Online accessibility

Online or web accessibility refers to presenting content in a way that allows everyone to access the same information, regardless of their abilities.

Web accessibility is a priority for Council and Council is committed to meeting Level AA of the Word Wide Web Consortium \(W3C\) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\) 2.0.

Council's commitment to web accessibility is covered in the [Access and Inclusion Plan 2012 â€“ 2017](http://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community/community-support/disability-services/brisbane-access-inclusion-plan-2012-2017).
